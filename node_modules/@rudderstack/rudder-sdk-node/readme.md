# RudderStack Node.js SDK

The RudderStack Node.js SDK lets you track your customer event data from your Node.js applications and send it to your specified destinations.

Refer to the [**documentation**](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-node-sdk/) for more details.

## Installing the SDK

Run the following command to install the Node.js SDK via **npm**:

```bash
$ npm install @rudderstack/rudder-sdk-node
```

## Using the SDK

To create a global RudderStack client object and use it for the subsequent event calls, run the following snippet:

```javascript
const Analytics = require("@rudderstack/rudder-sdk-node");

// we need the batch endpoint of the Rudder server you are running
const client = new Analytics(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL/v1/batch");
```

## Supported calls

Refer to the [**SDK documentation**](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-node-sdk/) for more information on the supported calls.

## Initializing the SDK for data persistence

> **This is a beta feature. Contact us on our [Community Slack](https://rudderstack.com/join-rudderstack-slack-community) in case you face any issues.**

RudderStack has a data persistence feature to persist the events in Redis, leading to better event delivery guarantees. Also, the SDK can retry event delivery multiple times as the queue is maintained in a different process space(Redis).

| To use this feature, you will need to host a Redis server and use it as the intermediary data storage queue. |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

A sample SDK initialization is shown below:

```
const client = new Analytics(
  "write_key",
  "server_url/v1/batch",
  {
    flushAt: <number> = 20,
    flushInterval: <ms> = 20000
    maxInternalQueueSize: <number> = 20000 // the max number of elements that the SDK can hold in memory,
                                                                // this is different than the Redis list created when persistence is enabled
  }
);
client.createPersistenceQueue({ redisOpts: { host: "localhost" } }, err => {})
```

To initialize the data persistence queue, you need to call the `createPersistenceQueue` method which takes two parameters as input - `queueOpts` and a `callback`. The `createPersistenceQueue` method will initialize a Redis list by calling [Bull's](https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull) utility methods. 

> **If you do not call `createPersistenceQueue` after initializing the SDK, the SDK will not implement data persistence.**

Read the detailed [documentation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-node-sdk/#nodejs-sdk-data-persistence) for more information on `createPersistenceQueue` and the other [configurable parameters](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-node-sdk/#configurable-parameters).

### Event flow

For more information on how the event flow occurs with data persistence enabled, refer to the [documentation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-node-sdk/#event-flow).

### Limitations around data persistence

- Refer to this [page](https://gitter.im/OptimalBits/bull/archives/2018/04/17) to understand the limitations
- For more details on the limitations, read: https://redis.io/topics/cluster-tutorial#redis-cluster-data-sharding
- As a workaround, refer to this page: https://gitter.im/OptimalBits/bull/archives/2018/04/17. We pass a prefix with default value as {rudder}.
