This page explains the steps you need to follow to set up the Ntfy
connection in Automatisch. If any of the steps are outdated, please let us know!

If you use ntfy.sh, the official public server for this service, you do not need to set up a connection with a custom configuration. It's enough to create one with the default server URL.

However, if you have a ntfy installation, that's different than ntfy.sh, you need to specify your server URL on Automatisch while creating a connection. Additionally, you may need to provide your username and password if your installation requires authentication.
