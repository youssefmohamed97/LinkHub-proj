# Request Integration

You can request a new integration by using [Github issues](https://github.com/automatisch/automatisch/issues).

:::info

While we are working hard to add as many integrations as possible, it might take some time to see your request is being done. It's because we prefer to collect all integration requests and prioritize the most requested ones.

:::tip

If there is already an integration request for the service you'd like, it's still crucial to upvote or comment on that issue for us to analyze the potential audience around the integration.
