I have and will provide the basic outline of what happens, but I would love someone who knows the game and can be super energetic, engaging and funny to turn this into something much more watchable, by creating an engaging, energetic and funny voiceover / first person narration of the events. \n\n[A good guide for the type of tone and content I want in the final deliverable is really any content on the youtube channel \"Johnny Minecraft.\"]\n\nI will provide a video file of the edited video (with sound effects and music). I would like to receive a .wav file of the final voice over that I can just pop in (no timing adjustments) and mix into the audio. Again, the timing of the audio file should be the final timing. \n\n Hoping this is clear enough, if you not, ask me questions in the proposal. \nAlso, the character is male so that is the voice I'm looking for.\n\nThanks!",

        "description": "We are looking for a skilled video editor to create engaging and professional intros for our podcast episodes. The style and quality we\u2019re aiming for are similar to those used by Jay Shetty in his podcast \"On Purpose.\" Here\u2019s what we\u2019re looking for:\n\nKey Elements\nVisuals and Aesthetics:\n\nClean and Minimalist Design: The intros should feature a clean, minimalist design that is visually appealing but not overwhelming. Subtle animations or transitions should add a professional touch, keeping the focus on clarity and elegance.\nHigh-Quality Imagery: Use high-resolution visuals that align with the podcast\u2019s theme. The color scheme should be calm and inviting, creating a warm and engaging atmosphere.\nText and Typography:\n\nBold and Readable Fonts: Text should be bold, easy to read, and aligned centrally to draw attention. Typography should be modern and clean, with key information like episode titles or guest names prominently displayed.\nSubtle Text Animations: Incorporate smooth and subtle animations for text as it enters and exits the screen, enhancing professionalism without distracting from the content.\nB-roll Usage:\n\nContextual Visuals: Select B-roll footage that complements the episode\u2019s theme, such as scenic shots, abstract visuals, or relevant clips that add depth to the narrative. The B-roll should enhance the storytelling rather than just serve as filler.\nSmooth Integration: Ensure that the B-roll transitions smoothly with the primary footage, maintaining a coherent visual flow that keeps the audience engaged.\nPacing and Timing:\n\nConcise and Engaging: The intro should be brief\u2014typically between 10-15 seconds\u2014quickly engaging the viewer and transitioning smoothly into the main content. It should be punchy and effective at grabbing attention without overstaying its welcome.\nStrategic Use of Music: Background music should be carefully chosen to match the tone of the episode\u2014calm, inspirational, and uplifting. The music should complement the dialogue rather than overpower it.\nSound Design:\n\nAtmospheric Music: Use background music that is aligned with the episode's tone, creating an uplifting and reflective mood. The audio mix should ensure that music enhances the narrative without overshadowing it.\nLayered Sound Effects: Subtle sound effects should be layered over the visuals to enhance the immersive experience. These effects should emphasize certain points or transitions within the intro, contributing to a polished and professional sound design.\nNarration and Voiceover:\n\nPersonalized Voiceovers: If applicable, include a brief voiceover to summarize the episode\u2019s theme or introduce the guest. The voiceover should be conversational and relatable, helping to establish a connection with the audience right from the start.\nRequirements:\n\nExperience in creating high-quality video intros, particularly in the style of Jay Shetty\u2019s podcast.\nProficiency in video editing software like Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, or similar tools.\nCreativity and attention to detail to deliver polished, professional content.\nHow to Apply:\nPlease submit your portfolio or examples of similar work, along with a brief explanation of how you would approach creating an intro for 'It's Up There Podcast.' For reference, you can check out this video by Jay Shetty: Jay Shetty Video Intro Example. Please also provide any additional public links to similar work if available.",
