        "description": "I am a middle school teacher that has moved to a small school district. I went from teaching 1 subject all day, to 6 different subjects, and I am overwhelmed and need some help. I am looking to outsource the creation of some resources based on our textbooks. These resources are very simple, but somewhat time consuming. There are 3 units from 3 middle school science texts, 6th, 7th, and 8th grade (attached). The units are divided into lessons, and contain about 3-5 lessons per unit. I need the lessons in the units read, and about 2 basic reading comprehension questions created per page on a Word document (example attached). The units average about 20 pages of middle school level reading, and would average about 16 questions per lesson. The goal is to just have basic reading comprehension questions to answer as the students read. Each unit also contains vocabulary words, (about 20) and I need those words made into a matching vocabulary quiz for each unit, also on a Word document (example attached). All I did in the resources I have created so far, is I read each page and tried to come up with a basic reading comprehension question. I try for two per page, but sometimes there is only 1 paragraph and I can only get one question, and some pages are longer and require about 3 questions. I need questions from the text only, not from any of the images, math toolboxes, etc..., just the printed text. For the vocabulary I just combine all of the vocabulary at the start of each lesson in the unit (not the academic vocabulary also listed), put them in order on the left of a Word document, and the definitions from the glossary on the right (not in order) with letters for matching, as you can see in the example. The work is very simple, and the skills required would be excellent English reading skills, the ability to create decent basic reading comprehension questions for middle school students from existing text, ability to use/have access to Microsoft Word, with basic knowledge of Word formatting. This job posting is for 3 units, one from each grade level. I would estimate that all of this could be completed easily in one or two days. I will have many more units I will need the same resources for, so if the price is right and the work good, I would prefer to use someone who is already trained for the remaining units. I just don't have time to scan all of the pages for all 3 textbooks at once.",
